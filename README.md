You can integrate this as a Claude Code hook to receive affirmations during your coding sessions.

#### Setup as User Prompt Submit Hook

   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ~/.config/claude-code/settings.json
   
   # Windows
   %APPDATA%\claude-code\settings.json
   ```

2. Add the UserPromptSubmit hook configuration:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python /home/andrew/src/affimations/affirmation.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Now every time you submit a prompt to Claude Code, Claude will receive an affirmation!

### Adding New Collections

In interactive mode (`-i`), use the `add` command to create new collections from markdown content:

```
What would you like to do? add
Collection ID (no spaces): my_mantras
Collection title: Daily Mantras
Type (affirmations/song_lyrics/poem): affirmations

Paste your markdown content (end with empty line):
- I am capable of achieving my goals
- Today brings new opportunities
- I choose peace and positivity

âœ… Added collection 'Daily Mantras' with 3 lines!
```

## Data Storage

- Affirmations are stored in `affirmation_data.json`
- Progress and history are automatically tracked
- Collections cycle automatically when completed

## Default Collection

The program includes Jimmy Cliff's "The Harder They Come" lyrics as the default collection, featuring empowering lines about perseverance and fighting for justice.
